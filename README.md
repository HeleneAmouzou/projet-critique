# About the project

## 💡 Origin of the project

✍🏾 I like to list, track and rate everything in life. I used to have an account on [betaseries](https://www.betaseries.com/) to check and rate tv shows, then I subscribed on [SensCritique](https://www.senscritique.com/) to make list and post reviews on movies I saw. Finally I recently join [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), which I find very complete regarding movies (I particullary enjoy the Diary function and I can't wait to be on December to see the resume of what I have seen during the all year).

🤔 All those applications were great but didn't reach my expectations when I wanted to include other culture topics I wanted to track and rate. What if I wanted to track and rate books I have readen ? Exhibition I have saw ? Live show I have assisted to ? And what if I wanted to do all oh this in the same place and not having to juggle between applications ?

🚀 This is why I have decide to try to developp an application allowing me to do that. I will be inspired by all the similar applications I have already used and I hope I will finally have the perfect tool matching my needs !

➡️ **TL;DR** : I want to developp an app where I can track and rate every cultural item I consum (movies, tv shows, books, live shows, theater plays, exhibitions and other).

## 💪🏾 Challenges

🤓 I will try to do the things right and document the process as much as possible.

❌ As I have started my developper carreer in the main time ChatGPT came into our lives, it is very common that I reach it everytime I have a question or a bug. For this project, I will not use it and force myself to RTFM, find my anwsers in doc, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues or else.

🤸🏾 Let's go !
