# Fronted technologies

In this section, I will explain my technologic choices regarding the fronted part.

## React

I have choose to use [React](https://fr.legacy.reactjs.org/) because it is a library I have already used in the past and I think it is appropriate for the template composed of components I am thinking of.

✏️ Note : I also considered [Lit](https://lit.dev/), which is a small libray to build web components I am using in my daily worklife, but as I wanted to improve my skills in React, I have finally droped out Lit.

## TypeScript

I have hesitated between using Javascript or TypeScript. I finally choose [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), because I wanted to take advantage of the typechecking TypeScript offers. Moreover, I wanted to improve my skills with this language.

## Vite
